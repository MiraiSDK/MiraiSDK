/* This object is called a simple framebuffer because all it allows
   is a texture serving as a color attachment point and a renderbuffer
   serving as a depth attachment. It also isn't too nice that it
   directly manages the renderbuffer for depth.
   
   It'd be more powerful if we also wrapped framebuffer in a way
   that allows more finetuned manipulation of attachment points.
   However, for the time being, we don't need that.
